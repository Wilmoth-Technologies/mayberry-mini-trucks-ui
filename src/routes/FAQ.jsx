          question: 'How Long Does a Mini Truck Last?',
          answer: 'Mini Trucks typically go for 120,000 miles and beyond. It depends on how well you care for them. Upon delivery your truck is fully serviced and all major systems are functional. We keep all major parts for servicing in our inventory for you to purchase and we offer preventive maintenance services to prolong the life of your Mini Truck.'

        {
          question: 'Are they Street Legal?',

        },
        {
            question: 'Do They Go "Off-Road"?',
            answer: 'Japanese Mini-Trucks are completely at home in the woods or on the trails. Since they are four wheel drive they can go anywhere a side-by-side or four wheeler can go. These versatile little vehicles are widely utilized throughout Asia, in agriculture, fisheries, construction and even for firefighting. More than half the time they go to family farmers and hunters.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What are they most frequently used for?',
